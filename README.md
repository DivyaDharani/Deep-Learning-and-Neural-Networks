# Deep Learning - Classification using Convolutional Neural Networks

A 9-layer ***Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)*** is built and trained for classification task with the SVHN (Street View House Numbers) dataset which contains printed digits cropped from the house plate pictures belonging to 10 classes, using Keras deep learning library in Python, employing:

* ReLU and Softmax activation functions

* Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) optimizer

* Categorical Cross Entropy loss function
